          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 – 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

          <h2>FATHER OF NATION</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> 02 October 1869 – 30 January
            1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; mahatma is an honorific meaning "great-soul" or "venerable" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for "father", papa"). <br  />

            Gandhi on Mahabharata said he wished to live his life like Karna lived, "The one who grew up against all odds and emerged out to be the greatest cultural hero India has ever seen. Breathe your life like Karna and Ramachandra. he sorrows life gave them and how they reacted upon them. You would be able to achieve what human history had never imagined." Gandhi was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him the title of 'Mahatma'.
            
            Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through a non-violent protest.
